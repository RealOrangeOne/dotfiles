# dotfiles
Settings and Preferences for transfer between machines

## Usage
First, install waf using the `install-waf.sh` script.

Next, simply run `waf <section>` to install the specific section.


## Automation
Alternatively, you can run `./INSTALL_ALL_THE_THINGS` to install all the section automatically.

__Note__: This script will run them in the order they appear in the `wscript` file. If something needs to be done first, put it first in the file!
