# dotfiles
Settings and Preferences for transfer between machines

## Usage
1. run `make`
2. ???
3. Profit!

## Extra hotfixes
Some things don't need to be installed everywhere, So they're in seperate scripts listed here, or under `extras`.

#### `gnome/sound-fix.sh`
Disables the sound when you change the volume, and set's the increment to 1. Much nicer if i'm using a volume wheel!
