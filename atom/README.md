# Atom Sync-Settings

Settings for atom are now stored in the gist at [https://gist.github.com/RealOrangeOne/9f9a4dd799ad01aa0502a09f06cbf454/](https://gist.github.com/RealOrangeOne/9f9a4dd799ad01aa0502a09f06cbf454/) and synced using [this plugin](https://atom.io/packages/sync-settings).

This makes syncing them between machines far easier than my old implementation of Owncloud sync and symlinks!

#### There's a lot of revisions on this gist!
Unfortunately, this setup also stores the version number of the plugins, which means that a revision has to be made every time a package needs to be updated. It does kindof annoy me with all the spam, but at least it's not really obvious, and I'm sure there's a way of cleaning it up!
